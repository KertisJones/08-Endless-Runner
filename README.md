One Run Dungeon: The Endless Runner is the official spinoff title of the critically ignored Fall 2016 Hoosier Games project, One Run Dungeon. Jump over pits (any key) and sprint past goblins (click) in your desperate attempt to crawl through this dungeon in just one run!

All assets used here are from the One Run Dungeon project.

This is the seventh assignment for ILS-Z399: a side-scrolling 2D game.

Fork the repository, update the code, change the LICENSE and the README.md, and then submit a link to your repository on Canvas.

You have a lot more leeway on this assignment than on previous projects. The simplest version of this would probably be an endless runner, but any kind of 2D side-scroller will meet the requirements of the assignment.

My example uses sprites provided by Bevouliin ([http://bevouliin.com](http://bevouliin.com)) under a Creative Commons Attribution License.
